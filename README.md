# Predicting Problem Gamblers in Online Casino Databases ðŸŽ²

## ðŸ’¡ Idea in a Nutshell
The goal of this project is to **analyze and predict problem gamblers** within an online casino database.

## ðŸ“– Background
Predicting problem gamblers has been attempted in the past by various companies. Some businesses have developed specialized software to tackle this issue, but details of their models are often proprietary. This project aims to address this by developing an **open and transparent program** for identifying players at risk of gambling addiction.

## ðŸ“Š Data and AI Techniques
- **Data**: Anonymous real-world dataset from an unnamed gambling company, spanning the past x months.
- **AI Techniques**: To be decided; exploration is ongoing.

## ðŸš€ Usage
The program can be utilized by **any gambling company** that seeks to predict problem gamblers within their player base.

## âš  Challenges
Currently, the program focuses exclusively on **problem gambling among casino players**.

## ðŸ”® What's Next
Future improvements could involve:
- Developing **personalized messages** for at-risk players to encourage safer gambling behaviors.
- Potentially reducing harm caused by excessive gambling through proactive interventions.
